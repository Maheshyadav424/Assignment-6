1) Perform the following operations to provide the implementation for a
Rectangle class. The operations are:
1. Add an area() method to the Rectangle class.
2. Create a Square class that satisfies the following conditions:
○ It is a subclass of Rectangle.
○ It contains a constructor and no other methods.
○ It can use the Rectangle class' area method to print the area
of a Square object.



ANS:


// Rectangle class
class Rectangle
 {
  constructor(length, width)
 {
    this.length = length;
    this.width = width;
  }


  area()
 {
    return this.length * this.width;
  }
}


// Square class (subclass of Rectangle)
class Square extends Rectangle
 {
  constructor(side)
 {
    super(side, side);         // Call the parent class constructor with the side value for both length and width
  }
}



// Example usage
let rectangle = new Rectangle(4, 6);
console.log("Rectangle Area: " + rectangle.area()); // Output: 24



let square = new Square(5);
console.log("Square Area: " + square.area()); // Output: 25
